# -UART-Tx-Rx-using-Verilog-
o	Transmitting UART converts parallel data from the master device (e.g. CPU) into serial form and transmits in serial to receiving UART. Tx blocks: FSM, Serializer, Parity Checker, and MUX.
o	Receiver consists of: FSM, Data Sampling, De-serializer, Start Check, Stop Check, Parity Check, Edge Bit Counter.
